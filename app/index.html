        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</p>
        <p>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</p>
        <p>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
        <p>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn</p>
        <p>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</p>
