 <h2>Description</h2>
 
 <p>A fun and simple JavaScript dice game.</p>
 
 <p>This project was build for a coding challenge in the Complete JavScript Course. The task was to write just the JavaScript code behind, but after completing that, I decided to improve the visual appearance and also, make the game fully responsive. I have used this oportunity to practice my web automation skills as well.</p>
